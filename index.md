# Purchase Request Platform

The Purchase Request platform creates a unified workflow for a library to receive, consider and process book purchase requests.  The primary goals are:
- to get more patron input on book purchase requests, from multiple sources
- to assist selectors in evaluating the requests
- and to assist technical services staff in acting on them.
